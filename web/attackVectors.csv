Description,Likelihood,Impact,Contingency - to do if happens,Response - how to prevent,Implemented?
Someone else intercepting transmission between user and the server,Unknown - but see Response,Risk of breach of confidential data,Pause the collection of data,"Use ""Let's encode"" to generate an SSL certificate",Yes
Breaking password - generally,Depends on how effective hashing is and number of attempts,Compromises a user's account until detected,"Lock out the users account when detected, and allow users to request an e-mail with new password",Use of one-way hashes of passwords,Yes
Breaking password through brute force,Depends on user's password robustness,A fraudulent user could pretend to be someone else.,,Use google captcha for login and registering to make it harder to brute force the page,Yes
Accessing the mySQL database,Need my original password to log into ecowebhosting,Everything is compromised!,Change my password - BUT also need to detect it,Email the team any time someone logs onto the server?,not yet
mySQL injection,Assume highly,"Whilst passwords can't be accessed, any ability to edit the tables could disrupt data collection, and potentially allow a malicious user to redirect where data is sent. Not sure how they'd decrypt it though.",,,only very basic protection so far
Someone else messes with a user's profile while they are away from their machine,Possible/likely with sufficient users,Messing with the user's resources,Restoring their resources through the dropbox version control. This doesn't necessarily protect the user from creation of extra experiments on the Collector server though.,30 minute timeout of session which logs them out of collector.,Yes
